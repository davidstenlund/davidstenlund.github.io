<h1 style="text-align: center"> Sample course material </h1>

<p>
The material below provides a snapshot from a lecture in the course MATH 307 &ndash; Applied Linear Algebra, which I have taught a total of four times at UBC during 2021&ndash;2023. 
</p>

<h3> 1. Sample lecture plan</h3>

<p>These are <a href="files/math307-lecture-plan.pdf">my handwritten notes</a> with preparations for a 75 min lecture on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). In the lecture plan I would typically write down some questions for my students, and here I have also indicated the estimated time needed to go over the material, so that I can better keep track of the time and adjust the pacing if needed. 


<h3> 2. Video recording from actual lecture</h3>

<video width="400" height="300" controls>
  <source src="files/DFT-lecture.mp4" type="video/mp4">
It seems that your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p> 
This is a video recording of part of the lecture (ca. 10 min), including a demonstration of filtering out certain frequencies from a digital sound recording.
The video file is compressed due to limits on file size. </p>

<h3> 3. Lecture notes</h3>

<p> The <a href="files/math307-lecture-notes.pdf">lecture notes</a> are always scanned and uploaded to the course webpage after the lecture. 
In this case, the final page was rather hastily sketched during the lecture, and therefore I rewrote that page a bit neater before scanning the notes. 
</p>

<h3> 4. Python example</h3>

<p> A <a href="files/jupyter/DFT-print.pdf">Jupyter notebook</a> was used during the lecture to illustrate how to compute and modify the DFT using Python.
